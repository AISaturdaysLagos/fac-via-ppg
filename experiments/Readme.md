### Experiment 1
Research question: Can I convert a lecture video's audio file to an audio with any accents of my choice but the same content as the speaker?


1. Download the checkpoint folder which contains the tacotron and waveglow checkpoints for the two speakers (ykwk and zhaa)
2. Download a lecture with an Americal professor --> I've provided ~ 1.15min in the audio folder /audios/ame_01_14.mp3. I got this from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwqNsSTjgbc&list=PL0E2BBC166A745313&index=3&ab_channel=America%27sProfessor)
3. I converted the L1 (american professor) to both L2 speakers (ykwk and zhaa). Listen to the audio in /audios
4. Experiment marked as successful by me.
